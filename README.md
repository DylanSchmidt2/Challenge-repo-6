# Weather App !

This challenge was given by The University of Minnesota Bootcamp 

These CSS, HTML, and JavaScript documents, utilize Ajax, Jquery, local storage and a handful more things that make this weather app really fun and dynamic for the user

### This project has the following features: 
* _Search city_ button
* A _clear cities_button
* A _recent searches_ button
*_Local Storage_

### Icons
The user will notice an assortment of icons throughout the application. These icons come directely from 'openweatherapi', they simply, represent an overall weather for that city. These icons change depending on rain, snow, wind, clouds, ect. and are displayed on each day in the 5 day forecast section
    
### Bugs

* Missing wind in 5 day forecast (at time of submission)---acceptance criteria
* Does not adjust to queried city local time
* Certain _common city_ names wont be directly accessible to the user, as they are spelled too similarly. (Nashville, Tennessee and Nashville, Indiana)

### Extra add-ons

###### I enjoy adding quality of life (qol) functions to assignments, time permitting. Unfortunately, I didn't have time to bring them to life on this assignment.


### Final thoughts
Putting together this application has been by far, the most collaborative, ***final product*** I've produced. I started off finding a github that was built similarly what I thought would work. Looked at lots and lots of the different ways people beat this one, it was great. I found a good block of HTML that set my columns up great and that moved me the right direction. I took in code and input from more than 10 different people on this project. Which is much more than previous assignments. Mostly talking through it with project members and my tutor. I do want to emphasize Javascript Ln. 100-130. That was a big help I found on github, I could not wrap my head around what we were accomplishing and the syntax along with that. Lastly, please check out my psuedocode! I go into some more detail with labeling things and explaining functions.

###### Biggest struggle
I decided to use Ajax's 'get' feature instead of the ('fetch') command we have been learning in class. I was pretty lost in some documentation trying to piece it all together.
